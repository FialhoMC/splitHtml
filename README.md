# HTML Partial Extractor

This Ruby script, `html_partial_extractor.rb`, splits an HTML file into modular partials. It detects HTML sections marked by comments, saves each section as a partial file in the `partials` directory, and generates a new `index.html` that references these partials.

## How It Works

The script looks for HTML comments that indicate section boundaries:
- `<!-- begin: section_name -->` marks the start of a section.
- `<!-- end: section_name -->` or `<!-- End of section_name -->` marks the end of a section.

Each section found is saved as a separate partial in the `partials` directory, while the main HTML file references these partials.

## Requirements

- Ruby (recommended version: 3.3.5 or later)
- `FileUtils` library (part of the Ruby standard library)

## Usage

1. Make sure Ruby is installed on your system.
2. Run the script from the command line:
   ```bash
   ./html_partial_extractor.rb path/to/your/index.html
   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/index.html` with the path to the HTML file you want to split into partials.

3. The script will generate:
   - A `partials` folder where each section is saved as a partial file.
   - A new `new_index.html` file that references the partials.

## Example

Given an HTML file with the following sections:
```html
<!-- begin: header -->
<header> ... </header>
<!-- end: header -->

<!-- begin: main_content -->
<main> ... </main>
<!-- end: main_content -->
```

The script will output:
- `partials/_header.html`
- `partials/_main_content.html`
- `new_index.html` with references to these partials.

## Script Structure

### Section Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: The name of the section.
  - `content`: Stores the lines of content within the section.
  - `children`: Subsections nested within the current section.
  - `parent`: The parent section, if any.
  - `start_comment`, `end_comment`: The opening and closing comment markers of the section.
  - `full_path`: Path used to organize sections hierarchically in the partials directory.
- **Methods**:
  - `add_child`: Adds a subsection to the current section.
  - `calculate_full_path`: Computes the full directory path of the section.
  - `partial_name`: Returns the filename for the sectionâ€™s partial.
  - `partial_reference`: Returns the reference path for the partial, used in the new HTML file.

### HTMLPartialExtractor Class
- **Methods**:
  - `extract_partials`: Main method that parses the document, generates partials, and creates the new index.
  - `parse_document`: Reads the HTML and identifies sections using comments.
  - `create_partials`: Recursively creates partials for each section.
  - `create_new_index`: Generates a new index file with references to partials.

## Error Handling
- The script will exit with an error if no HTML file is provided as an argument.
